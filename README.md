# Record Management System (C++)

A simple *file-based Record Management System* written in *C++*.  
This project demonstrates core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), sorting, searching, and exporting records to CSV â€” all through a *command-line interface (CLI)*.

## âš™ How It Works

1. *Data storage* â†’ Records are written into a binary file books.dat.  
2. *Reading & Displaying* â†’ File is scanned and records are displayed in tabular format.  
3. *Search / Update / Delete* â†’ Records are located by ID, then updated or removed.  
4. *Sorting* â†’ Records are read into memory, sorted, then displayed.  
5. *Export* â†’ Records are written into books.csv in standard CSV format.  

---

## â–¶ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the project in *Visual Studio*.  
3. Build and run the solution (RecordManager.sln).  
4. Use the CLI menu to interact with the system:

  1.	Add Record
	2.	Display All Records
	3.	Search by ID
	4.	Update Record
	5.	Delete Record
	6.	Sort Records
	7.	Export to CSV
	8.	Exit

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 (or later)  
- C++17 enabled in project settings  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This project does *not* use MySQL or any external database.  
- All persistence is handled with a **binary file (books.dat)** and optional **CSV export (books.csv).  
- Input validation is included (e.g., preventing duplicate IDs, invalid years).  

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add filtering (e.g., search by title or author).  
- Support multiple record types (students, employees, etc.).  
- Add JSON/SQLite export option.
